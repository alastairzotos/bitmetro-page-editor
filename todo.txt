Default theme:
    - navbars:
        - site name & logo (in theme settings)

Content editor:
    - Todo:
        - Finish default theme, use it to make my website
        - move into separate package

        - Copy/paste
        - Drag & drop in flex (or inline-block) components
        - Valid (or invalid) items in slots (i.e., card top slot should only take image)

        - view editor at different breakpoint sizes (maybe set them somewhere)
            and set each column size for each (i.e. xs, sm, md, lg)
        - full screen editor


Page editor:
    - Todo:
        - cmd+s or ctrl+s for save
        - Prefab editor, save to db etc

        - Preview with different theme versions

Pages should also have title property, and maybe some metas or something
